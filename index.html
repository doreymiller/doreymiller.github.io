            Ekko is an open source framework that provides <b>realtime
              infrastructure and in-transit message processing</b> for web
            applications. 
          </p>
          <p>It allows for web developers to easily add realtime
          features to their web apps by abstracting away the complexity of
          <b>managing realtime connections</b></managing>, which can become challenging when
          these features and connections need to scale. </p>
          <p>Ekko also provides the
            ability to add <b>serverless functions as custom middleware</b>, allowing
            developers to apply business logic to their realtime communications in a 
            modular and reusable way.</p>

          <h1>More About Me</h1>
          <p>I love to make things.  I love to solve problems.  Some of my favorite things to do are hiking 
            in the mountains and solving the daily NYT Crossword (not at the same time).  
          </p>
          <p>I have backgrounds in <b>music composition</b>, 
            and <b>interaction design</b>.  Prior to becoming a software engineer, I was a <b>stay at home mom</b>.  I wrote an article
            on Medium about my career transition, which you can read 
            <a href="https://medium.com/launch-school/rebuilding-a-career-after-stay-at-home-parenthood-abffd48f9269" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>My love for developing software includes everything from <b>OO design</b> to debugging and load testing.  I
            appreciate elegant code and learning new <b>algorithms</b>.  I'm 
            happiest when working with a team of developers and enjoy the experience of co-creation and <b>collaboration</b>.
          </p>
          <p>I can do the whole stack, however I'm most experienced with backend development.  I am fluent
            in <b>Javascript</b>, but also have experience with <b>Ruby</b> and <b>Go</b>.  On the frontend, I have worked with 
            <b>React/Redux</b>, <b>Vanilla JS</b>, <b>Handlebars</b>, <b>JQuery</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>HTML5</b>.  On the backend, I have worked with <b>Node JS</b> and 
            <b>Sinatra</b>.  
          </p>
          <p>I also have experience working within the <b>AWS</b> ecosystem, specifically ECS, EC2, Lambda, Fargate, 
            Elasticache and S3, as well as working with <b>Docker</b> containers.</p>
